### Required Readings
#### Introduction to Cloud Automation Technologies

There are a number of different Cloud Automation Technologies that you may encounter in your career.  The good news is that these tools have robust development communities, which leads to continuous innovation and feature enhancements.  In this course, we focus on HashiCorp Terraform, which is an open-source tool.

Infrastructure as Code Tools like Terraform are used to provision new cloud infrastructure and provide a high-level abstraction of cloud resources.  Terraform enables you to deploy multi-cloud infrastructure using common tools.  

There are a lot of materials to review this week.  It's okay if you spread these out over the next two weeks.

Before getting into the specifics of Terraform, you should watch [this video on Mutable vs Immutable Infrastructure - 11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II4PFe9BbmE).  With modern cloud platforms, we try to build immutable infrastructure, which is vastly different than the traditional datacenter infrastructure that you may be familiar with.  With immutable infrastructure, we don't upgrade or change our existing infrastructure.  If we need to change something, we build a new system or systems and then move user traffic from the old to the new.  This reduces risk significantly and is the approach used by many of the cloud-based systems that we use on a daily basis.<br>

#### Web-based SaaS Automation Tools
Another type of automation tool, such as Zapier, enables you to chain multiple SaaS applications together.  A common use case might be to link your Google Mail account to a Google Drive account and have Google Mail automatically drop a copy of all attachments into a special folder.  Another use case would be automatically syncing data from Dropbox to Google Drive.

##### Zapier

Note: You aren't required to use Zapier in this course.  I am providing this information to you for your own professional growth purposes.

### Required Hands-On Practice Exercises
You do **NOT** need to turn these in for a grade, but you **DO** need to do these for practice.  You will perform similar tasks for your project.  You will use either your GCP or AWS environment - it does not matter which you use.  If you are struggling, please come to one of the Q&A or Tutoring sessions.  If you are unable to attend, please watch the recorded videos before seeking a 1:1 session.  Most of the time, the videos will help you resolve the issue.<br>

If you have chosen to work with Google Cloud Platform, then do the nine (9) [Terraform GCP Getting Started tutorials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/gcp-get-started).<br>

If you have chosen to work with Amazon Web Services, then do the eight (8) [Terraform AWS Getting Started tutorials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started).  You may also optionally do these [Terraform Configuration tutorial for AWS](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/configuration-language) and [Terraform Modules tutorial for AWS](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/modules) exercises.<br>
