### Required Readings

#### Introduction to Cloud Automation Technologies

There are a number of different Cloud Automation Technologies that you may encounter in your career.  The good news is that these tools have robust development communities, which leads to continuous innovation and feature enhancements.  In this course, we focus on HashiCorp Terraform, which is an open-source tool.

Infrastructure as Code Tools like Terraform are used to provision new cloud infrastructure and provide a high-level abstraction of cloud resources.  Terraform enables you to deploy multi-cloud infrastructure using common tools.  

There are a lot of materials to review this week.  It's okay if you spread these out over the next two weeks.

Before getting into the specifics of Terraform, you should watch [this video on Mutable vs Immutable Infrastructure - 11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II4PFe9BbmE).  With modern cloud platforms, we build immutable infrastructure, which is vastly different than the traditional datacenter infrastructure that you may be familiar with.<br>

#### Web-based SaaS Automation Tools
Another type of automation tool, such as Zapier, enables you to chain multiple SaaS applications together.  A common use case might be to link your Google Mail account to a Google Drive account and have Google Mail automatically drop a copy of all attachments into a special folder.  Another use case would be automatically syncing data from Dropbox to Google Drive.
