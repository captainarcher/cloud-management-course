[Classroom Virtual Board](https://www.thomasu.me/boards/cloudmgmt-fall2020)

****About the Virtual Board Feature:****
I may use a virtual board during my lecture recordings to aid in the learning process.  The link above will generate a unique instance of the board for each student, so you are welcome to write notes on the board and only you will see them.  If you wish to save your notes, you must use the "Export Board" link at the top of the board or take a screenshot of the content.  A unique board is generated each time that you visit the board link.  A new page will be added to the board for each Module in the course.<br>
