The learning resources for this class are broken up into 11 modules.  Each module has a README file, which contains a summary of the module objectives and any reading or video materials.

Recorded lectures are available through my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3vqKF4jspXh8hxFLpTfsyw?view_as=subscriber)

****About the Virtual Board Feature:****
I may use a virtual board during my lecture recordings to aid in the learning process.  The link above will generate a unique instance of the board for each student, so you are welcome to write notes on the board and only you will see them.  If you wish to save your notes, you must use the "Export Board" link at the top of the board or take a screenshot of the content.  A unique board is generated each time that you visit the board link.  A new page will be added to the board for each Module in the course.<br>
