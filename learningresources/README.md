#Learning Resources
The learning resources for this class are broken up into 11 modules.  Each module has a README file, which contains a summary of the module objectives and any reading or video materials. 

Recorded lectures are available through my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3vqKF4jspXh8hxFLpTfsyw?view_as=subscriber)
