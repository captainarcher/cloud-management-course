# Module 1

## Overview
This first module will introduce you to the course expectations and then shift to an introduction to Cloud technologies.  Next, we will explore cloud enablement technologies such as virtualization.  Then, we will talk about the business impact that cloud technologies have had on organizations.  We will wrap up this module by walking you through the steps needed to configure your Cloud platform accounts, access Cloud platforms, and then provision your first virtual machine for homework activities.  ****This first module forms a critical foundation for the rest of the course.  You do not want to fall behind.****

****About the Virtual Board Feature:****
I may use a virtual board during my lecture recordings to aid in the learning process.  The link above will generate a unique instance of the board for each student, so you are welcome to write notes on the board and only you will see them.  If you wish to save your notes, you must use the "Export Board" link at the top of the board or take a screenshot of the content.  A unique board is generated each time that you visit the board link.  A new page will be added to the board for each Module in the course.<br>
