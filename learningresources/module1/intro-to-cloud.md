# Introduction to Cloud

This unit starts by defining cloud computing, explains the different service delivery and deployment models, and then differentiates between Cloud and traditional IT models.  Next, the unit discusses business impacts, financial models, and the basic capabilities common to cloud platforms.  Finally, the unit provides examples for how cloud-based technologies have transformed the IT job market.

## What is the Cloud?
According to the [National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-145/final), Cloud computing provides rapid access to shared pools of resources, such as compute, storage, networks, applications, services, or libraries using an on-demand, utility-based model. The characteristics of a cloud computing model include self-service, network access, resource pools, rapid elasticity, and metered resource usage \[Endnote 1\].



## Cloud Service Delivery Models

There are three primary cloud service delivery models: Infrastructure as a Service \(IaaS\), Platform as a Service \(PaaS\), and Software as a Service \(SaaS\).

### Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS
| **Description** | **Examples** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Infrastructure services such as computing, storage, and network are virtualized and provided for consumption through the Internet for deployment of applications, operating systems, etc.  The end-user has significant control over what can run on the platform, but does not have control over the underlying hardware infrastructure. | Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\), Amazon Web Services \(AWS\), Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, DigitalOcean, Alibaba Cloud |

### Platform as a Service or PaaS
| **Description** | **Examples** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Programming languages, libraries, application programming interfaces \(APIs\), services, and tools are provided for consumption through the Internet for the development and deployment of the end-user organization's own applications.  The end-user of a PaaS service subscribes to one or more of these PaaS services running on cloud infrastructure.  The end-user has no visibility into, nor the ability to manage the underlying infrastructure. | Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk  |

### Software as a Service or SaaS

| **Description** | **Examples** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Applications are provided for consumption through the Internet.  The end-user of a SaaS service subscribes to one or more of these SaaS applications.  The end-user is not responsible for managing anything. | Box, Dropbox, Salesforce, Google Apps for Business, Slack, Office365 |

## Cloud Deployment Models

There are multiple cloud deployment models, but our course's focus will be on public cloud.  

### Public cloud
The public cloud environment is designed for use by any member of the general public that wishes to subscribe to it.

There can be different classifications of public cloud environments that align with regulatory requirements, geographical restrictions, and security restrictions.  

#### Examples
[<li>Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com)<br>
[<li>Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com)<br>
[<li>Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)<br>

### Private cloud
A private cloud environment is designed for use by a single organization.

### Hybrid cloud
This is when organizations implement both public and private clouds using technologies to facilitate interoperability between the platforms.

### Multi-cloud
This is when organizations implement multiple public cloud providers to minimize the risk of vendor lock-in.  In a multi-cloud deployment, organizations leverage third-party tooling to manage resources.

### Community Cloud
This type of cloud environment is designed for use by a community of common end-users with shared requirements.  These are less common than other cloud types.

## Differences Between Cloud and Traditional IT Service Delivery Models

The primary differences between Cloud and Traditional IT Service Delivery Models lies in who is responsible for what.  In cloud-delivery models, organizations have the least amount of responsibility with SaaS and the greatest amount of responsibility with IaaS.  Despite having greater responsibility, IaaS still enables an organization to offload responsibility of physical systems and facilities to a third-party.  In traditional IT delivery models, an organization is responsible for everything when they run an in-house data center.

## Impact on Businesses
Students should read the article below, which is available through the CSUSM library.  You will need to use your CSUSM credentials to authenticate to the library's systems.  This article discusses cloud computing's disruptive nature in enterprise software.

Boillat, T., & Legner, C. (2013). From on-premise software to cloud services: The impact of cloud computing on enterprise software vendors' business models. Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research, 8(3), 39-58. Retrieved from https://ezproxy.csusm.edu/login?auth=shibboleth&url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1493991633?accountid=10363
Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm that allows users to conveniently access computing resources as pay-per-use services. Whereas cloud offerings such as Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud and Google Apps are rapidly gaining a large user base, enterprise software's migration towards the cloud is still in its infancy. For software vendors the move towards cloud solutions implies profound changes in their value-creation logic. Not only are they forced to deliver fully Web-enabled solutions and to replace their license model with service fees, they also need to build the competencies to host and manage business-critical applications for their customers. This motivates our research, which investigates cloud computing's implications for enterprise software vendors' business models. From multiple case studies covering traditional and pure cloud providers, the authors find that moving from on-premise software to cloud services affects all business model components, that is, the customer value proposition, resource base, value configuration, and financial flows. It thus underpins cloud computing's disruptive nature in the enterprise software domain.

## Cloud Financial Models

There are multiple financial models used by Cloud providers:

* Subscription
* Usage-Based
* Freemium
* Free, advertisement or data supported
* Mix of the above

Cloud services that use the subscription model can be described as being similar to renting a home, rather than purchasing one.  With a subscription model, a company provides a specific set of services for a fixed subscription fee.  Examples of Cloud services that use this model are Salesforce and Google Apps for Business.

Cloud services that use the usage-based model can be described as being similar to a utility provider, such as electricity, natural gas, or water.  With a usage-based model, a company provides services that are measured and billed based on actual usage.  Examples of Cloud services that use this model are Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure.

Cloud services that use the freemium model can be described as offering a taste of the service for free and then add-ons that cost money.  Dropbox, Google Apps, and Box are examples of the freemium model.

Cloud services that use the free, advertising model can be described as offering the services for free to the end-user, but they either show advertisements to the user or monetize the user's data.  An example would be Google Docs.

## Basic Capabilities of Cloud

Cloud based systems provide the following basic capabilities \[Endnote 1\]:

* On-Demand Self-Service
* Broad Network Access
* Resource Pooling
* Rapid Elasticity
* Measured Service
