The project instructions will be added soon.  

## General instructions
This project is designed to give you a practical business problem to solve using what you have learned in this course.  This immersive learning activity will prepare you for a career in the MIS field and you are encouraged to use this as an example for your portfolio.  You will need to conduct analysis of the business problem, perform independent Internet research to see how similar problems have been solved by others, and then complete five different types of assignments.  These assignments range from an executive level presentation of a proposed solution, an architecture drawing of the proposed solution, and then three technical implementations (automation, infrastructure, and security).

## Submission Instructions
In addition to submitting to the box under Module 15 in Cougar Courses, all Terraform and Vault configurations need to be committed to your private GitHub project repository (Your_Name_MIS484-6_Project) that you shared with Professor Underhill in Homework #5.  DO NOT use a Public GitHub repository!

## Hypothetical
CougarFlix is the largest video streaming service for college-aged students.  The company currently runs its own IT infrastructure in a Mira Mesa data center and a disaster recovery facility in Virginia.  The company’s video production facilities are in a large skyscraper in downtown San Marcos, which has been closed due to COVID-19.  After seeing the success of the Saturday Night Live @ Home series, the company has decided to move all production to the homes of employees.  This poses a problem, because the existing IT infrastructure is not adequate for a distributed workforce let alone video production and distribution.  Your manager, the VP of IT, has asked that you put together a proposal for the company to shift all IT infrastructure to cloud-based providers.  Your proposal will consist of 5-7 slides and a 1-minute “elevator pitch” video that highlights the advantages of cloud adoption.  In addition, you will design and implement a pilot cloud deployment for the organization’s corporate website using common automation and security software.  You may not simply propose using a SaaS (Software as a Service)-based service like WordPress.com, Wix, or Squarespace.  You must propose using either Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform for this project.   <br>

## Executive Presentation
You will create an executive presentation slide deck in PowerPoint format (5-7 slides) and separately record a 1-minute “elevator pitch” video (YouTube or Vimeo) pitching your proposed Cloud Adoption plan to executive leadership.   

Videos exceeding 1-minute or under 1-minute will be penalized as follows:
<li>Less than 30 seconds (No credit)
<li>31-40 seconds (-75% penalty)
<li>41-50 seconds (-50% penalty)
<li>51-60 seconds (No penalty)
<li>61-70 seconds (No penalty)
<li>71-90 seconds (-25% penalty)
<li>91-120 seconds (-50% penalty)
<li>121-180 seconds (-75% penalty)
<li>Greater than 181 seconds (No credit)
