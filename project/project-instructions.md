The project instructions will be added soon.  Your project will be submitted to the box in Cougar Courses under Module 15.
## Executive Presentation
## Cloud Architecture Design Drawing

## Cloud Automation Deployment
Your automation deployment will programmatically deploy infrastructure to your chosen cloud provider.  Your deliverable for this assignment will be the GitHub URL containing your repository with Terraform files.  You have your choice of sharing a public repository or private repository, but if you choose private, then you need to ensure that Professor Underhill's GitHub account is added as a collaborator (@captainarcher).
## Cloud Infrastructure Deployment
Your infrastructure deployment will be based on your architecture drawing.
## Cloud Security Deployment
