Copyright (C) 2020 Thomas Underhill.  All Rights Reserved.

## Prerequisites

You must complete all other homework assignments and all modules up through and including Module 8 before starting this assignment.

You must have Terraform installed on your Linux system.  

You must have Git installed on your Linux system and configured for your GitHub account.

You must be confident in using Git, GitHub, and Terraform.  If NOT, then go back and practice some more.

## Objective
Upon the completion of this assignment, you should be able to use Terraform to provision network, compute, and storage infrastructure in either GCP or AWS.

## Instructions
Decide whether you will work in AWS or GCP and then skip to the appropriate section of the instructions.  You only need to do this on one cloud platform, but whichever you use, then that is what you need to use for Homework 7 as well.

If you have not gone through the Terraform Tutorial exercise in the Module 6 instructions, then STOP NOW!  You need to complete that exercise first.

If you have not setup GitHub yet in Homework 5, then STOP NOW!  You need to complete Homework 5 first.
