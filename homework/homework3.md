<br>
1) Use the DEV mode when starting Vault.<br>
  2) You will skip the Dynamic Secrets engine lesson.  AWS Educate does not support IAM.<br>

You will either use your existing virtual machine from earlier homework assignments or build a new virtual machine specifically for Vault.  It doesn't matter which cloud platform that you use - you may use either GCP or AWS.  You should follow the Vault Linux installation instructions in the Install Vault lesson.  Although you could install Vault on Mac or Windows, if you choose to do that, I will not be able to help you work through issues with that process.
