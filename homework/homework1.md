# Homework #1: Getting Started with Cloud Infrastructure

## Prerequisites
In order to complete this assignment, you must already have your Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services accounts setup.  If you haven't done this yet, refer to the instructions located in Cougar Courses.

## Objective
Upon the completion of this assignment, you should be able to create simple cloud infrastructure in Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services using the web-based Graphical User Interfaces (GUI).

## Instructions
There are two parts to this assignment.  You must complete both parts to receive full credit.  

In the first part, you will provision a Linux virtual machine (VM) into Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and then connect to it from your web browser.  

In the second part, you will provision a Linux virtual machine (VM) into Amazon Web Services (AWS) and then connect to it from your web browser.  

You will document your progress in a brief report that meets the requirements below:
<ul>
  <li> MS Word or PDF document
  <li>12-point font
  <li>Single-spaced
  <li>Minimum of 8 total screenshots of your progress (4 screenshots for GCP and 4 screenshots for AWS)
  <li>Minimum of 500 Words combined for both parts
  <li>Organized using an Introduction, Reflection, and Conclusion style
  Your reflection will be a discussion of your progress as you complete the homework, including describing any challenges, how you overcame any challenges, and what you learned on this assignment.

###### Please be sure to review the explanatory, "walk-through" videos on my YouTube channel.

## Part 1: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
1.	Complete the [GCP Quickstart-Linux Tutorial](https:/cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-linux)
2.	Power off your VM, until you are ready to begin Homework #2.  If you plan to immediately begin Homework #2, then you may leave your VM running.  You will need your VM for Homework #2, so do not terminate it.

## Part 2: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
1.	Follow the [AWS EC2 Linux Tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html).

NOTE: If desired, you may optionally open and print a PDF version of the tutorial using the PDF link at the top.  There is also a Kindle version available. When you are finished, please stop this VM instance.  You will use this VM instance in other homework assignments, so please do not terminate it.
